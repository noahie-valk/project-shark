# Introduction

I'm excited to share that I've wrapped up my first cybersecurity project as part of **Project Shark**â€”a secure, straightforward **Password Manager** built with Python. This project pulled me into the world of **cryptography**, **secure data storage**, and **application development**, and it was a rewarding learning experience.

## About the Project

The Password Manager lets you securely store and manage your credentials with strong encryption and a clean, user-friendly interface. Here's what it can do:

- **Master Password Authentication:** Protect your credentials with a master password.
- **AES Encryption:** Every credential is encrypted for top-notch security.
- **Credential Management:** Add, update, delete, and view your stored credentials with ease.
- **Password Generator:** Generate strong, random passwords on the fly.
- **Clipboard Security:** Copy passwords to your clipboard, automatically cleared after 10 seconds.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Simple, intuitive design built with `tkinter`.

## What I Learned

This project taught me a ton about:

- **Cryptography Basics:** Implementing **AES encryption** for secure storage.
- **Secure Authentication:** Hashing and verifying master passwords with `bcrypt`.
- **Python GUI Development:** Crafting user-friendly interfaces using `tkinter`.
- **Packaging Applications:** Using `PyInstaller` to bundle Python scripts into standalone executables.
- **Security Best Practices:** Managing sensitive data securely, from clipboard handling to encrypted databases.
